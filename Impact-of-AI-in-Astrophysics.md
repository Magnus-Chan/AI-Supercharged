# AI-Supercharged
### The Impact of AI in the Scientific Community.
AI is reshaping the way individuals throughout the scientific work. It has already begun to transform how researchers analyse data and uncover new discoveries. Specifically, in astrophysics, the efficiency of AI opens opportunities to focus more on critical thinking.

The benefits of AI are clear. Its excels in consistently processing massive datasets from modern telescopes, simulations and satellites. Additionally, the pattern recognition functions of machine learning algorithms have been applied to cosmic microwave background data (Caldeira et al. 2019), identifying exoplanet potentials from light curves (Shallue & Vanderburg, 2018), as well as classify galaxy types (Dominguez Sanchez et al., 2018). These capabilities are already fast and accurate, and provide astrophysicists the freedom to concentrate more on evaluating results instead of processing them. Moreover, newer deep learning models are capable of evaluation too, such as detecting smaller gravitational waves in noisy data.

On the other hand, these developments come with their own risks. There is a danger of becoming over reliant on these AI tools, which could reduce transparency of scientific results. It will become increasingly challenging to understand each researchers specific data processing, misplacing the confidence in findings across the scientific community - a type of integrity that is crucial to maintain. Also, junior researchers will find less opportunities to develop complex analytical skills, and struggle even more with understanding specific AI data processing without the foundational knowledge it is built on. In the quest of discovery, scientists do not focus on each otherâ€™s personal background, but AI infrastructures are improving at an exponential rate. This could easily result in specific nations with cutting-edge AI tools or infrastructure leading scientific research with a significant advantage.

To conclude, AI is clearly a remarkable tool to improve efficiency of both data analysis, observation and evaluation. At the same time, we must be careful with how rapidly all tools are being used and ensure integrity is kept, foundational skills are still taught, and aim to for equality in science.

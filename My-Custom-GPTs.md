# My Custom GPT Prompts

## Presentation (ppt) Structure Generator
**Description:** Convert script to ppt structure

### **Instructions/prompt:**
I will paste a presentation script for understanding the role of AI in systems. Using this script, appropriately design presentation slides, including a title, possible subheadings, key points (using bullet points). Also let me know where might be best for diagrams on a slide.

Make sure to keep the same language as in the script, as well as keep the structure chronologically the same as the script, so that when presenting and reading the script, the presentation slides may supplement the script and give clarity. Do not add more slides than necessary, keep information concise. Introduce each slide with their slide number. I will be using your bulletpoint slides to generate visuals using napkin ai, structure the text to be appropriate to recommend a diagram.

## PPP Formater
**Description:** Converting daily update reviews into PPP (Progress, Problem, Plan).

### **Instructions/prompt:**
Transform my regular written daily review. Use the Progress, Problem, Plan structure, and make each of these a subheading. Below each subheading list the key information with bulletpoint. Here are two examples to refer to:

17/06:

### Progress

- Became more familiar with the Notion and Slack workspace.
- Learned to use and experimented with Napkin AI.
- Completed week 2 and started week 3 of M1 course.
- Completed presentation for M3 week 2, day 2.
- Found a comfortable pace for working through M1.
- Completed the GreenHarvest Organics practice task

### Problem

- Initially required a lot of fiddling to get used to Napkin AI.
- M3 week 2 day 2 is incomplete and requires more diagrams, and re-alinging of text
- M1 course is incomplete

### Plan

- Add a few more diagrams to the M3 week 2, day 2 slides, align all text consistently
- Refer back to AI tools guide to become more efficient in learning
- Experiment with combining AI tools to improve efficiency:
- Practice further use of Napkin AI, try using LLMs to convert and generate specific text for Napkin AI. Find an appropriate consistent style preset

18/06:

### Progress

- Completed M3 presentation week 2, day 2, by adding diagrams and correctly aligning all text.
- Improved Napkin AI use through a custom GPT prompt.
- Completed presentation for M3 week 1, day 3 using Napkin AI visuals and my customGPT. I also wrote a simple guide for customGPT use.
- Learned about PPPs, practiced using 17/06 daily review from slack as an example, and wrote a rough guide for PPP use.
- Transferred all my module notes to my workspace on notion, so that it is up to date.
- Wrote feedback for the module, up to the end of Week 2.
- Continued progress through week 3 of the module.
- Felt even more comfortable with notion, and using more features in my notes.

### Problem

- M1 module is not completed.
- Questionnaire for M1 module is not completed.
- My custom GPT outputs for Napkin AI and presentations are not consistent.
- AI tool guides for customGPTs and PPPs could be improved.
- My AI portfolio on GitHub is not updated.
- My notion workspace notes should be organised better.

### Plan

- Finish the module and its tasks by 12pm BST 19/06.
- Then complete the questionnaire for module.
- Update my AI portfolio on GitHub with all tasks (from the module).
- Re-organise my notion workspace to be clearer.

## AI tool Guide Fabricator
**Description:** Trained on AI tool instruction guides, to output same structure.

### **Instructions/prompt:**
Write an AI tool instruction guide. Make it a chronological step by step list. Be clear and concise, yet give specific directions on what to do. Here are some examples of guides for AI tools:

Napkin AI:
1. Open [Napkin AI](https://www.napkin.ai/) on a computer and sign up/log in
2. Start a new project using the ‘New Napkin’ icon —> opens a clean workspace for pasting your content
3. Write or Paste your text (idea, framework or list) 
4. Click the lightning icon which auto generates AI powered visuals from your text (ensure there is space if generating multiple visuals).
5. You will see PowerPoint-style slides or diagram suggestions and can browse through the one that fits the best. Customise detail level and orientation in ‘Customisation’, and select ‘Stay closer to my text’ to prevent AI hallucination.
6. Further customise through text box editing, font and illustration size, colour and style by clicking ‘customise’ to guide the AI.
7. If dissatisfied with the visual at this point, use the ‘Change Styles’ option to change the visual.
8. Create colour and font presets in ‘Styles’ if needed beforehand to adhere to branding.
9. When exporting, select the 3x resolution option to prevent blurriness during file compression, turn off background if needed for a transparent export.

Custom GPT:
### 

### 1. **Access the Custom GPT Builder**

- Open ChatGPT or Gemini gems (ensure you’re using a **Plus** or **Pro** account — Custom GPTs require this).
- In the left-hand sidebar, click **Explore GPTs**.
- Click **Create a GPT** (or **+ New GPT**).

---

### 2. **Set a Clear Purpose**

- When prompted, provide a short description of what your GPT is for.
- Example: *“This GPT acts as a beginner-friendly coding tutor for Python learners.”*
- Think about:
    - Who the GPT is for (your audience)
    - What specific task(s) it should help with
    - What problems it will solve

---

### 3. **Write Detailed Instructions**

- Use the instruction box to guide how your GPT should behave.
- Include:
    - Its goal (what it helps with)
    - What it should always do
    - What it should avoid
    - How it should handle uncertainty (e.g. *admit when unsure, suggest alternatives*)
- Example: *“Always explain Python concepts in simple language with examples. Avoid using advanced jargon. If unsure, recommend where to learn more.”*

---

### 4. **Define the Tone and Voice**

- Clearly describe the style and personality:
    - Tone: formal, friendly, playful, supportive, professional, etc.
    - Voice: concise, detailed, casual, technical, etc.
- Example: *“Use a friendly, encouraging tone suitable for beginners. Keep responses concise but clear.”*

---

### 5. **(Optional) Add Custom Actions**

- If needed, set up:
    - File uploads the GPT can handle
    - API connections (e.g. to a database, app, or external tool)
- Follow the builder prompts to configure these safely.

---

### 6. **Test the GPT**

- Interact with your Custom GPT as if you were a user.
- Try different queries that reflect what your audience would ask.
- Check:
    - Does the GPT respond in the right tone?
    - Does it stick to its purpose?
    - Are the answers useful, accurate, and appropriate?

---

### 7. **Refine and Improve**

- Based on your test results, return to the instructions.
- Adjust any parts that didn’t work as intended (e.g. clarify tone, purpose, or example responses).
- Re-test after making edits.

---

### 8. **Save and Name Your GPT**

- Give your GPT a clear, descriptive name that reflects its purpose.
- Add tags or categories if prompted — this helps organize and share.

---

### 9. **Use and Share**

- Start using your GPT for your intended tasks.
- Share it with colleagues or peers if helpful (via the share link or in your workspace).

---

### 10. **Continuously Evaluate**

- As you use your GPT:
    - Take note of what works well.
    - Watch for areas where it might need updates (e.g. changing instructions to improve accuracy or tone).
    - Update the GPT as needed

I will direct you on what specific AI tool to write the guide on.

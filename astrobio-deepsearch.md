**My astrobiology research query:**

I’d like to know the methods and indicators used to infer the presence of serpentinization processes on exoplanets. This could be through spectral signatures, atmospheric composition, or surface mineralogy. I’m looking for as long a record of studies as possible, and for observations or models that estimate current or past serpentinization activity. I’m not looking for general studies on serpentinization on Earth or other solar system bodies unless they directly inform detection on exoplanets.

**Response:**

*“To tailor the research properly, could you clarify a few points?*

1. *Are you primarily interested in observational techniques (e.g., spectral data from telescopes), theoretical modeling approaches, or both?*
2. *Do you want studies that include indirect inference based on exoplanet characteristics (e.g., mass, temperature, likely mantle composition), or only those that propose specific detectable signatures?*
3. *Should I prioritize peer-reviewed journal articles, or include conference proceedings, preprints, and white papers as well?*

*Let me know so I can refine the research accordingly.”*

**Reply:** “All of the above.”

**Results:**

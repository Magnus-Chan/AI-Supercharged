# Meta-Prompting Example
### (Tool: Deepseek)
Walk me through building a clear prompt using What? Why? How? and guide me with easy, one-at-a-time questions so I can tweak my ideas step by step?

First, ask what big goal Im hoping to reach. When I reply, move on to the exact task I want the AI to tackle. Next, see if any background information or extra detail would improve the answer. Finally, check how I would like the output out-format, tone, style, visual supplements or anything else necessary.

Once we nail all those points together, please turn them into a smooth, ready-to-use prompt. Additionally, prepare for extra refinements and suggestions for refinements.
